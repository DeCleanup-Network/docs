# Web3 Pillars

## Decentralization
- Removes single points of failure
- Guarantees uptime for key functions
- Ensures data permanence on-chain

---

## Trustless Operations
- Wallet login, no emails or KYC
- Smart contracts verify all submissions and rewards
- Secure campaign creation and reward distribution

---

## Interoperability
- Works across EVM chains
- Follows ERC standards (NFTs, tokens)
- Integrates with IPFS, WalletConnect, ENS

---

## Scalability
- Modular smart contracts for campaign logic
- Handles global events and high user volume
- Supports campaign expansion and third-party integration

---

## Security
- Geotag & timestamp validation
- Cryptographic proofs and decentralized storage (e.g. IPFS)
- Minimal attack surface via contract design and wallet auth
