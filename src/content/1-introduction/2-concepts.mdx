# Core Concepts

## Proof of Impact (PoI)
Verified evidence of cleanup activity, submitted as:
- Geotagged photos before and after cleanup
- Timestamped metadata
- Optional consent to allow DeCleanup Network to share submitted photos on social media

---

## Dynamic Impact Products
Evolving NFTs tied to a user’s environmental record
- Reflects user level, upgrade with every PoI
- Serves as onchain reputation in the ReFi ecosystem

---

## $DCU – DeCleanup Utility Token
The native token used for:
- PoI rewards
- Staking & credibility
- Campaign bonuses & referrals
- Future governance actions

---

## Impact Value (IV)
A non-tokenized metric that measures real-world contribution.
- Earned with each level of Impact Product
- Tracks a user’s cumulative environmental impact
- Determines future IRL Impact Rank

# Web3 Pillars

## Decentralization
- Removes single points of failure
- Guarantees uptime for key functions
- Ensures data permanence on-chain

---

## Trustless Operations
- Wallet login, no emails or KYC
- Smart contracts verify all submissions and rewards
- Secure campaign creation and reward distribution

---

## Interoperability
- Works across EVM chains
- Follows ERC standards (NFTs, tokens)
- Integrates with IPFS, WalletConnect, ENS

---

## Scalability
- Modular smart contracts for campaign logic
- Handles global events and high user volume
- Supports campaign expansion and third-party integration

---

## Security
- Geotag & timestamp validation
- Cryptographic proofs and decentralized storage (e.g. IPFS)
- Minimal attack surface via contract design and wallet auth
