# Concepts

Decentralized application (dApp) to serve as entry point for users can submit cleanups and system can allow community to reward;

DeCleanup dApp provides the ability for individuals and groups to tokenize their cleanup efforts by trading the proof of their impact (photo of cleanup) to dynamic Impact Products, representing Real World Impact of cleanups onchain and tied with growing with every level Impact Value and DCU Points, which are then converted into DCU Tokens. 

Below are web3 pillars which help to build strong solution

---

1. **Decentralization**:

   - Eliminate single points of failure
   - Never offline runtime env
   - Multiple languages support

2. **Trustless Operations**:

   - Workflows without requiring intermediaries.
   - Auth made easy - access is managed by cryptography on chain
   - Balances are stored on chain as crucial data

       3. **Interoperability**:

   - Design the platform to function across multiple blockchain ecosystems, adhering to global standards for compatibility.

4. **Scalability**:

   - Build modular and upgradable systems capable of supporting increasing user demand and complex asset interactions.

5. **Security**:

   - Use cryptographic proofs, decentralized storage, and immutable ledgers to protect assets and transactions.
