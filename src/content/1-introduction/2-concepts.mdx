# Concepts

**Proof of Impact (PoI)**: Verified evidence of cleanup activities through geotagged photos or videos.

**Dynamic Impact Products (dIPs)**: NFTs with traits that evolve based on user contributions and milestones.

**$DCU Utility Token**: A native token used for rewards, staking, and incentivized actions.

**Impact Circles**: Collaborative group cleanups that amplify collective environmental impact.
