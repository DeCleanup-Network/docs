# Introduction

DeCleanup Network is a global system for coordinating environmental cleanups and turning them into long-lasting digital impact. It connects individuals, grassroots groups, and partner organizations into a shared ecosystem, where every cleanup becomes part of a broader effort to regenerate the planet. By converting actions into onchain dynamic Impact Products, we enable recognition, traceability, and participation across regions and communities.
