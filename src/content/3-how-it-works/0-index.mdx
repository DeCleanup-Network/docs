# How DeCleanup Works

DeCleanup Network transforms environmental cleanup actions into verifiable digital impact. Here's how the platform works:

1. **Cleanup Action** - Participants engage in real-world environmental cleanup activities
2. **Digital Verification** - Actions are verified through our QR-based proof system
3. **Impact Generation** - Verified cleanups create Impact Products and earn $DCU tokens
4. **Community Engagement** - Join Impact Circles and participate in global campaigns

## Key Components

- **QR Verification System**: Simple, fraud-resistant proof of cleanup
- **Impact Products**: Digital assets representing environmental impact
- **Community Circles**: Local and global cleanup communities
- **Reward System**: $DCU tokens and achievement badges
