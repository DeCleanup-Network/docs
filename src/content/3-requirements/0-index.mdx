# Requirements

This section describes the necessary functions, features, and constraints of an DCU as system.

General process in dcu:

Connect Wallet: Users must connect their blockchain wallet to the platform to track their activities and rewards at the dashboard.
Submit Proof of Impact (PoI): Click to the “Tokenize Your Cleanup Impact” button and upload before and after photos showing cleanup area and waste collected. Ensure geotags and timestamps are embedded in the image metadata.
Verification: Submitted proof is sent to the Verification Page, where verifiers evaluate the submission for authenticity and impact. It takes 3 votes in the beginning to be approved or rejected, at the later stages of the project it might take up to 10. 
Get dynamic Impact Product (dIP): Once verified, users receive dIP of certain levels that have certain IV and DCU Points, growing with each cleanup submission and level gained.


## Impact Circles
Description: Collaborative cleanup campaigns where multiple users contribute to a shared initiative. Impact Circles are managed by a leader and allow for larger-scale environmental impact.
