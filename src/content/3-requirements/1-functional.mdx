# Functional

**Contracts**

- Token for DCU Submission Reward: ERC20 compatible, allowing use across other dApps. Unlimited total supply, minted on demand during reward transactions. Total minted supply can later determine the capped total supply for future $DCU tokens.
- NFT Dynamic Impact Product (DIP): Soulbound NFT with dynamic traits to reflect user impact. Stores data using the NFT standard schema. Transfer can be initiated upon request (e.g., account migration).
- NFT Cleanup Contract: Factory contract to manage cleanups. Deploys contracts for solo and group cleanups (Impact Circles). Metadata includes before/after photos, geotags, timestamps, and extended schemas (e.g., name, description).
- DCU Rewards Contract: Distributes rewards after DCU submission is confirmed. Has access roles for minting and interacts with other contracts. Updates traits in DIP on each confirmed DCU submission, either on-chain (ERC7496) or through backend updates of metadata and CID.
