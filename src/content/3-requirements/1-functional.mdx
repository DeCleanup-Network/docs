# Functional requirements

## contracts

- Token for dcu submission reward, based on ERC20 so it is compatible with many other dApps. And also possible to use later to claim other tokens if needed; Totaly supply is nlimited, minted on demand only in reward tx. Later, total supply mited can be used to determine total supply for next $DCU token.
- NFT DIP - Contract to mint soulbound NFT with dynamic traits. To store data based on NFT standard schema. Purpose is to show user's impact with dynamic traits. Transfer can be initiated on request, for example when user wants to migrate to another account.
- NFT cleanup - contract to manage cleanups. A factory contract to deploy contract NFT. To mint dcu submission. Deploy one contract for solor subs and deploy new contract for group cleanup - IC; This is standard NFT to represent cleanup, so metadata is extended with: before/after photos - so not only the main image. Geotags and timestamp of photos. And other metadata schema can be used, like name, description, etc. o
- DCU Rewards - contract to send rewards from. After user dcu submission confirmed - rewards should be distributed. This contract will have access role in other contracts and can mint. It will be triggered by tx from moderator/dao;

it is important to update traits in DIP on each dcu submission confirmed; To do we need to update them onchain if we use ERC7496 or it will be on backend by updating metadata and updated the cid on chain
