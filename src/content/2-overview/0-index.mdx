# Overview: DeCleanup Reward & Verification Ecosystem

DeCleanup dApp is a decentralized environmental impact platform that tokenizes individuals' and groups' for verified impact of cleanups. It combines proof-of-impact submission, reward mechanisms, and tokenized impact recognition to encourage active participation in sustainability efforts.

The system in V2.1 supports solo cleanups and in V2.2 Impact Circles (ICs) — coordinated group cleanups.

The incentives structure includes:

## Reward Mechanisms
DeCleanup Impact Product (NFT DIP) – A soulbound NFT with dynamic metadata and level progression, representing the user's environmental impact.
$DCU Token – An ERC-20 token earned for each approved cleanup submission. Users accumulate these off-chain (as DCU Points) until the Token Generation Event (TGE), when they can be claimed as $DCU tokens.

## How It Works
Submission: Users clean a location and submit proof through the dApp (before/after images with geotags and timestamps).
Verification: In Phase 1, the DeCleanup team manually reviews all Proof of Impact (PoI) submissions. In later phases, community-led validation with a staking system will decentralize this process.
## Reward Claiming: Once a submission is approved, users can mint or upgrade their NFT DIP and receive $DCU rewards.

## Dynamic Impact Product (DIP) NFT: Core of the System
Each Dynamic Impact Product (DIP) is a smart contract–based NFT representing a user’s cleanup history and impact level. The DIP is automatically updated with each verified cleanup, making it a living digital record of environmental contributions.
