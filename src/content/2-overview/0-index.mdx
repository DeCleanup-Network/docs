# Intro to Reward Ecosystem

**DeCleanup dApp** is a decentralized environmental impact platform that tokenizes individuals' and groups' verified cleanup efforts. It combines **proof-of-impact submission**, **reward mechanisms**, and **tokenized recognition** to encourage active participation in sustainability.

The current system supports:
- Solo Cleanups (V2.1)
- Impact Circles (ICs) – coordinated group cleanups (V2.2)

---

## Reward Mechanisms

- **DeCleanup Impact Product (NFT DIP)**  
  A soulbound NFT with dynamic metadata and level progression, representing each user’s environmental impact.

- **$DCU Token (ERC-20)**  
  Earned for each approved cleanup submission.  
  Accumulated off-chain as `DCU Points` until the Token Generation Event (TGE), when users can claim them as $DCU tokens.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Submission
Users clean a location and submit before/after images via the dApp, including:
- Geotags  
- Timestamps  
- Waste volume (optional)

### 2. Verification
- **Phase 1**: Manual verification by the DeCleanup team.
- **Future Phases**: Community-based validation system using staked voting for decentralization.

### 3. Reward Claiming
Once verified:
- Users mint or upgrade their NFT DIP.
- Receive DCU Points tied to their contribution.

## Dynamic Impact Product (DIP) NFT

Each DIP NFT acts as a living digital record of the user’s cleanup activity.
