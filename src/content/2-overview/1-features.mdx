## Dynamic Rewards:

- **DCU Token**: ERC20 token minted as a reward for confirmed cleanups.

- **Dynamic Impact Products (dIPs)**: NFTs with evolving traits and levels.

- **POAP**: Optional participation rewards for cleanups and Impact Circles.

## Data type for DIP extends basic NFT schema:

**constant traits:**

- type: "dynamic impact product"
- impact: "environmental"
- category: "tokenized cleanups"

**dynamic traits:**

- dcuSum: number # amount of DCU tokens earned by user
- impact: number # represent the impact lever by number
- title : string # label for impact: newbie, pro, hero
  Each confirmed submission updates the dIP's dynamic traits. Visual traits such as images evolve across 10 levels, with a planned system for expanding beyond these levels to accommodate more milestones.

## General Process in DCU

- **Connect Wallet**: Users must connect their blockchain wallet to the platform to track their activities and rewards on the dashboard.
- **Submit Proof of Impact (PoI)**: Click the "Tokenize Your Cleanup Impact" button and upload before and after photos showing the cleanup area and waste collected. Ensure geotags and timestamps are embedded in the image metadata.
- **Verification**: Submitted proof is sent to the Verification Page, where verifiers evaluate the submission for authenticity and impact. It takes three votes initially to approve or reject a submission. As the platform scales, this may increase to up to ten votes.
- **Get Dynamic Impact Product (dIP)**: Once verified, users receive a dIP of a certain level with specific Impact Value (IV) and DCU Points. These grow with each cleanup submission and level gained.

## Impact Circles

Collaborative cleanup campaigns where multiple users contribute to a shared initiative. Impact Circles are managed by a leader and allow for larger-scale environmental impact.
**Features**

- Leaders organize and manage Impact Circles.
- Participants contribute cleanup efforts and share rewards proportionally.
- Amplifies the scale and visibility of environmental impact.
