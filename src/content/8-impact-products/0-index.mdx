# Impact Products

Impact Products are **evolving digital collectibles** that grow with your environmental contributions. These unique NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) represent your cleanup journey and unlock exclusive benefits as you level up.

## What Are Impact Products?

Think of Impact Products as **digital trophies** that:
- **Evolve visually** as you complete more cleanups
- **Track your impact** with dynamic stats and achievements  
- **Unlock rewards** and exclusive community features
- **Showcase your commitment** to environmental action

Unlike static NFTs, Impact Products are **living assets** that change and improve with your continued participation.
