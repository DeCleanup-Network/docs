## Brief

We are building a **minimal, scalable web client template** for **MVP**. This app would be POC and is all about getting businesses (gyms, rentals, etc.) up and running quickly with their own branded frontends. We're setting up a solid foundation now, so it can easily be expanded later.

## Goals

- **Rapid Deployment**: Provide a clean, efficient template for quick setup.
- **Minimal & Modular**: Lightweight structure that is easy to extend.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Easy setup, solid documentation, smooth contributions.
- **Foundational Strength**: Focus on maintainability, performance, and scalability.
- **Core Only**: Keep it simple with essential pages and features.

## Definition of Done

### Initialize Project

- [ ] Start a new **React/Next.js** project.
- [ ] Remove unnecessary boilerplate.

### Project Structure

- [ ] Create key folders: (`components/`, `pages/`, `styles/`).
- [ ] Document folder structure in `README.md`.

### Integrate Core Technologies

- [ ] Add **Tailwind CSS** for modern styling.
- [ ] Use **ShadCN UI components** for consistent design.

### Basic UI Components

- [ ] Develop reusable components: headers, footers, navigation bars, buttons.
- [ ] Ensure simplicity and consistency in styling.

### Routing and Pages

- [ ] Set up basic pages: **Home**, **About**, **Contact**.
- [ ] Use **Next.js** for routing.

### Metadata & SEO

- [ ] Add essential HTML metadata (title, description, viewport).
- [ ] Include placeholder Open Graph tags.
- [ ] Add a **favicon** for branding.

### Development and Deployment Setup

- [ ] Add scripts for development and production (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`).
- [ ] Create `.env.example` for environment variables.
- [ ] Ensure **hot-reloading** is functional.
- [ ] Create a **Dockerfile** with **Podman** for containerization.
- [ ] Document development and deployment process in `README.md`.

### Logging, Error Handling & Health Check

- [ ] Add basic logging for key events.
- [ ] Use React error boundaries to handle UI crashes.
- [ ] Set up a `/health` endpoint for application status.
- [ ] Document the health check endpoint.

### Developer Productivity

- [ ] Set up **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code linting and formatting.
- [ ] Use **Husky** to add pre-commit checks via **Git hooks**.
- [ ] Document the setup for ease of use.

### Documentation

- [ ] Write a comprehensive `README.md` with an overview, setup steps, and contribution guidelines.

### Review & Finalize

- [ ] Conduct a **code review** to ensure adherence to best practices.
- [ ] Manually test core features and container setup.
- [ ] Ensure `README.md` provides complete and clear instructions.

## Summary of Deliverables

- A **React/Next.js web client template** featuring Tailwind and ShadCN components.
- **Docker/Podman setup** for container deployment.
- **Basic UI components and pages** to get started.
- **Developer tools** like linters and hooks for maintaining code quality.
- **Complete documentation** for setup, deployment, and contributions.

## Key Improvements

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Added a simple pipeline for fast deployments.
2. **Testing Setup**: Introduced linting and unit testing from the start.
3. **Developer Tools**: Integrated linters, formatters, and Git hooks for code quality.
4. **Task Flow**: Organized tasks logically for smooth developer onboarding.

## Conclusion

This epic delivers a **minimal web client template** designed for quick deployment as a proof of concept. It's built to be scalable, simple, and developer-friendly. Future iterations can build on this foundation by adding advanced features and making it production-ready.
