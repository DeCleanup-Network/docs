The SaaS All-In-One Booking System

## The Idea/Project-Possibility

- An all-in-one responsive progressive web booking application
  - For Muay Thai gyms, accommodation and shops in Thailand
- A front-end web application for the customers to
  - Book and reserve accommodation
    - With a visually appealing interface, representative of the physical location
  - Book and reserve "**[activities](#Dictionary)**"
    - i.e. Muay Thai classes (multiple), renting a bike, private sessions, etc.
  - View and purchase available products (**one-time-payment**)
    - I.e. food, boxing equipment, etc.
- The front-end application will be managed by the same application as the management system in the back-end will be
  - They log in as an administrator and they have the management tools for the back-end of the website
- The administrator of the system will be able to
  - **CRUD** accommodation and have it available for rent
  - **CRUD** activities to have available for booking
  - **CRUD** products to have available for purchase
  - Management of the accommodation, activities and products
    - Who has reserved and for how long?
    - Where is currently occupied?
    - How many training sessions have been redeemed?
    - Stock of the products available and sold
    - Export of sales reports for the business
  - Can handle in-person cash payments
- The web application will double as a progressive web application
  - Can install as an app on phone by adding to home screen
- The web application will be search engine friendly
- The website will be fully localised for at least **Thai** and **English** language
- The data is encrypted and safe
- The website should have the essentials for the business
  - Accommodation, transport, activities
  - Things that make the clients life easier when they arrive
- The website has simple social media integration
- Small scanner for asynchronous check-in
  - Training, check-out of accommodation, etc.
- An offline mode is essential, and the website should sync as soon as it's back online
- There are tiered levels of the application, so that different size businesses will have different tools

We'll create a **base** version of the system, which will then be **tailored, customised** and **deployed** for each business, allowing us to scale and manage multiple business websites at once.

We will also have a monitoring application for the **management** of all of the websites we've **deployed**.
This application will:

- Display the diagnostics of each of the deployed websites
- Display the error and info logs for each website
- Allow for the deployment of a website
- Easy controls for reverting back to previous versions or restarting the system

**Our aim is to create an MVP version of the system that can be used by multiple business owners here in Thailand**
